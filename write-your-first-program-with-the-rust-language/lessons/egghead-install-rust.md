Instructor: [00:00] To install Rust we head over to the Rust [website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and then we click Install. We scroll down to this curl command here. Copy it and run it in our terminal. 

```bash
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

This will ask us to customize the installation, but we'll just proceed with the default one and hit `1`.

[00:24] Once that is done, we have a few new commands, including rustc, the compiler program. We have cargo, the package manager, and we have rustup, the tool chain command.

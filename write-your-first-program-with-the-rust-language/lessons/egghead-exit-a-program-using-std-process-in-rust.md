Instructor: [00:00] **To exit a program, use the process module from Rust standard library, and then call `process::exit()`**, which will exit the program with an exit code. **Any exit code that is not `0` means that the program has exit with an error**.

```rust
use std::process;
```

```rust
...

match first.trim().parse() {
  Ok(val) => a = val,
  Err(_err) => {
    println!("Not a valid number!");
    process::exit(1);
  }
};

...
```

[00:19] We also no longer need to make our `a` variable mutable and assign an initial value, because the program will either assign an initial value, in case parsing was successful, or in case of an error it will exit the program.

```rust
...

let a:u32;

match first.trim().parse() {
  Ok(val) => a = val,
  Err(_err) => {
    println!("Not a valid number!");
    process::exit(1);
  }
};

...
```

[00:35] When we run this code and enter a falsy value, we now see that our program successfully exits.
